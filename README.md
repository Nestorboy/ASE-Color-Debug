# ASE Color Debug
A custom Amplify Shader Editor feature which enables the ability to display the color values of a given pixel from a node preview.

### Description
Whilst hovering your mouse over a node preview, you can hold down Control and a tiny display next to the mouse will show up.
The color debugger will only display the color channels which are enabled on the node preview.
Each channel is displayed and represented using a full 32-bit float, it also includes negatives, NaNs, and infinities.
